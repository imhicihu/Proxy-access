# RATIONALE #

Internal project that involves gather technical information about accessing our proxy server. That's a bottleneck that we face actually when we organize a symposium or a scientific meetings inside our location. We try to offer a solution thinking in the _worst_ scenario as possible and at the same time be agnostic to operating systems: our commitment is offer a solution to MacOS, Windows, Linux and mostly support to mobile devices.
